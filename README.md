 # song recommender mini project

I researched about the k-nearest-neighbors algorithm I learned about in my Data 8 class back in Spring 2019 and made modifications based on the large data file I downloaded from the Million Songs Dataset. I thought this would be applicable to a song-recommender because many songs can be recommended based on the listening history of users that have similar tastes.
