 # song recommender mini project

I researched about the k-nearest-neighbors algorithm I learned about in my Data 8 class back in Spring 2019 and made modifications based on the large data file I downloaded from the Million Songs Dataset. I thought this would be applicable to a song-recommender because many songs can be recommended based on the listening history of users that have similar tastes (that could be calculated by comparing the listening count for each song per user)

-song nb.ipynb: main notebook for analysis
-data copy.csv: data for the notebook (was shortened with some pandas code I wrote so it could be small enough to be uploaded)
